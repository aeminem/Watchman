This is the Watchman security framework. Watchman adds more random numbers to 
the heap and stack and checks them more frequently than existing security systems.
If you are compiling C and C++ code where security matters more than performance
then the Watchman framework is a good tradeoff to make. Watchman is still in alpha,
and is not ready for production.
